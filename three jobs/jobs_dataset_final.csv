"Lemurian Labs | Compilers, Hardware Simulation, Generalist SW Engineering | Principal, Sr, Intern | Full-Time | Remote-first, Global
At Lemurian, we're building a hardware accelerator for AI that's dramatically different from most semiconductors humans have built to date. We're re-thinking everything, down to the level of ditching IEEE floating point in favor of our own, improved, format. All that's left to do is draw the rest of the owl. If you're looking for a truly challenging, engaging, and highly rewarding project, you've found it.

The software team at Lemurian has three major projects for the year. One is a compiler which ingests models (think GPT-N, BERT, ImageWhatever, etc) and emits assembly the rest of our stack ingests. The second project in the pipeline is to ingest that assembly in a functional simulator (fsim), which emulates the hardware target at a slightly higher level than cycle-accuracy. The third project is tangentially related to, and builds on, the first two; validate the efficacy of the entire system. Some examples might be to analyze the tradeoffs of widening of our arithmetic type (think 8-bit vs 12-bit vs 16-bit), to quantifying the pressure on the L1 bus for different layers in BERT, to the efficiency tradeoffs between tiling a matrix multiply in one way, vs another.

The team at Lemurian is absolutely phenominal. There are plenty of 25-year-plus career engineers on the team, both on the hardware and software sides. The majority of the team have come from companies like 3dfx, nVidia, Intel, AMD, Google .. you get the idea. We highly value free-thinkers, lifelong learners, and those that are fearless in the face of the unknown. We have no preconceptions about what education or background makes an ideal candidate; a good number of the team members have PhDs and are steeped in academia, and some are scrappy, self taught hackers. Everyone brings a strong desire to learn, and excel. If you're highly motivated to do challenging work, with the goal of a net-positive impact on humanity, we want to hear from you.

If you made it this far, and you'd like to get in touch, I can be contacted by email: jesse@lemurianlabs.com"

Our first product is SDKs as a service – you send us your OpenAPI spec, and we generate pacakges in all the major languages and publish them to npm/pypi/etc (think `npm install your-company`). These SDKs are world-class: you get an idiomatic wrapper with autocomplete, types, etc. (I built a version of this at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)

We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.

From there, we plan to build out a rich family of developer platform products – everything an API team would need to deliver a terrific DX to their partners and/or customers.

We’re about a year old, under 5 people, have strong revenue, and are selling to companies you interact with every day. We’re backed by Sequoia, a bunch of (ex-)Stripe people, and founders of Next.js, Prisma, and Segment.

Fern Creek is a software consulting company. We build stuff for other people, usually in .NET on Azure but we do other stuff occasionally. The company has been around since I started consulting independently about 22 years ago.

We also have a SaaS product in the automotive racing space that does over 7 figures annually - and that is our little side project while we consult for other clients.

This is not super sexy stuff where you will get options that might be worth millions, but likely worth nothing. What you will get is a load of experience on new tech (asp.net core, azure, blazor etc) and a great focus on the best feature of all...shipping.

The job is remote so you don't have to be in Louisville Kentucky (where we are 'located') though if you are close that is cool.

Set your own hours and all that, I want pros not people that need babysitting.

Multiple openings right now as we are growing fast...

-BI/Data Warehouse/SQL Server specialist

-Desktop dev (WPF experience required)

-Full stack Web dev (asp.net core would be great, but any tech stack experience is fine)

Our primary language of choice is Python. Being a geospatial company, we use tools such as Rasterio, Pyproj, GeoPandas, and PyGEOS.

We are looking for both mid-level and senior engineers to help grow and maintain our scientific software toolchain.

If you have deployed apps to the cloud, have worked with large data sets, and value to conceptualize and build features for a growing product in a small team we would like to hear from you.

FullStory is an analytics and session replay tool that is used by PM's, Support, and Engineering teams to help their customers and improve their web and mobile apps.

On mobile, we use Private-by-Default, so it looks a bit more like a wireframe until various parts of the app are marked as safe to capture.

We’re looking for someone who’s probably a little more backend-heavy, with some mobile or mobile-adjacent experience, to help our mobile capture work seamlessly with everything else at FullStory. (The company was built around web and rolled out mobile more recently, so there are still some features such as heatmaps that need additional work to support mobile.)

Our backend is primarily written in Go (golang), although there is also a bit of Rust code. You might also work with TypeScript for our web interface, and Java/Objective-C for Android and iOS.

Great benefits: healthcare, 401k matching, equity, self-directed PTO (I tend to take about 5-6 weeks of vacation a year), good pay (not sure what the range is for this role, but I make $205k base with about 18 YoE), and a really great remote working experience.

OLV is an agency specializing in visual art production (mostly 3D, sometimes interactive) and bespoke software development. Our main product is Customizer, a white-label web-based 3D visualization and customization platform. So far we’ve been in the sports apparel industry, being used for custom jerseys/pants (https://uniforms.mizunocustom.com), footwear (https://cfw.mizunocustom.com), gloves (https://gloves.custom.rawlings.com), helmets (https://helmets.custom.rawlings.com), etc., and we’re expanding.

The challenges are very diverse, here are some recent ones: computational geometry (polygon offsetting, text warping, procedural texture generation, path splicing), data importing (parsing, validation and normalization of sewn pattern files), data exporting (generation of PDFs to be consumed by a textile factory), 3D viewer enhancements (free-form positioning and scaling of artwork directly on a 3D model), the list goes on.

In the near future we’ll be working on user and team accounts, internal tooling and automation around data ingestion (e.g., when a new type of t-shirt is added), administration tools for our clients, a light self-service version of Customizer, new rich customization features, developer experience and reliability improvements, and more.

The likely-constant parts of our stack are TypeScript and React. We also use Babylon.js for 3D, Redux, PostgreSQL, and have the strictest TypeScript configuration possible, a comprehensive ESLint setup, tests, Prettier, Yarn constraints, CSpell, all enforced by GitHub Actions.

We’re a growing team of senior generalists. The company runs on merit, so there is no bound on the impact we can have on the product and the technology behind it.

Two of our engineers work out of OLV's head office in Riga, Latvia, and the other two are in Panama and in the Canary Islands. We can employ directly in US, EU and UK, or contract worldwide. It can be flat rate or hourly, and the amount of hours per month and the benefits are negotiable.

"Open edX / OpenCraft | Full-time | TRUE REMOTE (async/worldwide) | Senior Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python/Django, AWS/Kubernetes
Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :)

Open-source

We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an open-first environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.

We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.

Remote-first

Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)

We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.

Online education

We are one of the main contributors to the Open edX project, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like edX.org, the MIT Open Learning Library, and the national online learning platform for France. We provide development and hosting for institutions like Harvard Medical School, Harvard LabXchange, Cloudera, Autodesk, and several governments. We are not affiliated with edX.org, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.

Our handbook, like much of our work, is publicly viewable and you can find it at https://handbook.opencraft.com/.

"Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote (US only)| Full-time | ONSITE (fully-remote now) | Visa Transfer
In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.

Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.

How can this be, and how can we change it?

Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.

Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.

But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?

Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.

In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.

Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.

Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.
